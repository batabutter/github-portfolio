                        I am passionate about learning software design
                        principles
                        and working with low level languages and backend tools.
                        Some of my lanugages include TypeScript, C++, C, and
                        Java.
                        Most of the programs I have worked on relate to
                        low-l;evel
                        systems design or programming.
                        I strive to become a compenet software engineer that

                    <p class="section-body">
                        Throughout my life, I have largely traversed every hill
                        and valley solo. My family does not have experience in
                        STEM fields, and I never had a formal mentor of my own.
                        In addition, throughout the early years of my high
                        school career, I didn’t have a great idea of what I
                        wanted to study or what my interests were at the time.
                        That was until I began seriously getting into
                        programming. I started programming in my sophomore and
                        junior years of high school, and I absolutely loved
                        learning ways to instruct machines to complete tasks. I
                        excelled in my first Computer Science class, and I ended
                        up becoming a teacher’s assistant in high school. As I
                        continued my programming journey, I found myself
                        interested in more specific subsets. I am extremely
                        interested in low-level programming, operating systems,
                        code optimizations, and backend programming. Each day, I
                        spend hours learning to become a more experienced
                        programmer.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Outside of academics, my strongest attribute that many
                        have described in me is my persistence and perseverance.
                        If I do not understand the task at hand or a concept, I
                        will spend my own time reviewing fundamentals or
                        researching the problem to make sure I have a good grasp
                        of the issue. In the age of AI programming, it is as
                        necessary as ever to have programmers who can adequately
                        review, debug, and analyze code. Subsequently, if there
                        is a gap in my information, knowledge, or skill, I will
                        recognize it and spend extra time developing that
                        knowledge.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        All in all, I love creating things and working on
                        projects that genuinely interest me. There is no better
                        feeling than being “in the zone” while working on a
                        passion project.

                    Reflective Essay:
                </h2>
                <p class="section-body">
                    My ultimate goal as a Computer Science and Mathematics
                    student is to utilize my knowledge of algorithms and
                    low-level programming to build a foundation to learn other
                    systems. My most proficient programming languages are C and
                    C++; however, I am also proficient in TypeScript and Python.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Currently, I am working on a 6502 emulator. The 6502 is an
                    older CPU that was used in the Commodore64 and the Nintendo
                    Entertainment System. I am emulating the CPU using C++, and
                    so far, I have fully implemented LDA instructions, as well
                    as reading, fetching, and operating on bytes. This project,
                    which is still ongoing, taught me a lot about software
                    design and structures using a modern language like C++.
                    Because I am simply emulating a CPU, there are many design
                    and OOP decisions that I need to make myself when
                    transferring machine instructions to a modern language.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Some of the higher-level projects I have worked on include
                    an environmental sensor monitoring web application for the
                    Department of Environmental Science at the University of
                    Maryland. As a group, we rebuilt the framework for the
                    original sensor monitoring website and continue to make
                    contributions, transferring the systems from the previous
                    site to the new system. The largest difficulty surrounding
                    this project was managing a codebase of which I was
                    unfamiliar. Currently, a small group and I are working on
                    transferring the data to a new repository on GitHub and
                    managing access to the server that holds thousands of sensor
                    readings.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Another project I’m quite passionate about is my
                    Multiplatform Tomodoro Timer. Using ElectronJS, I created a
                    Windows and Linux application that functions as a
                    customizable Pomodoro timer. A pomodoro timer is used to
                    create bite-sized work and break timers that help you stay
                    productive. Currently, you can set various timer presets to
                    separate working times and break times. I am currently
                    working on configuring presets that allow you to customize
                    the colors and visual appearance of the application.

                    <br />
                    I am a dedicated student and capable programmer, and I am
                    excited to learn more about software design throughout my
                    career. I hope to bring my strong work ethic and design
                    principles to your company.
